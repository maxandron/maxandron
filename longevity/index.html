<h1 id="longevity-research">Longevity Research</h1>
<p><strong>This is an early work in progress which should be viewed by no one and referenced for nothing</strong></p>
<p>Let’s start with the why. I may summarize the reasons later further but currently suffice to say that old people feel bad. When people get old, they are very likely to die because of cancer, heart desease, dementia, diabitis, or other aging related syndroms. These desease make people die in an unpleasant way, sometimes bed ridden for years before succumbing. Treating each desease individually is not good enough, we need to address the root cause which is aging. Although this is an emerging field, it is still very early research. There are a lot of competing theories which is why I decided to make this document, for myself, to organize my thoughts.</p>
<h2 id="hallmarks-of-aging">Hallmarks of aging</h2>
<p>One of the leading two directions of research in the field of longevity. The idea is simple - the human organism is very complicated to understand, so understanding the root cause of everything on a physical and chemical level will take a lot of time. Until we do understand that, we can still point to byproduct of the aging process. If we can find solutions for those byproducts one by one, we may be able to cure aging altogether. The analogy here is like maintaining your car instead of replacing parts only once they are broken.</p>
<p>There are nine hallmarks of aging:</p>
<p>Note: the following are explained very briefly, shallowly, potentially incorrectly, for ease of understanding.</p>
<p><strong>Genomic Instability</strong> - genomic instability is the result of gradual damage to DNA in ways that are not naturally repaired. Caused by x-rays, chemicals, sun radiation, and life.</p>
<p><strong>Epigenetic Alterations</strong> - when we age environmental factors make our epigenome change which changes the was our genome is acting. This causes a bunch of problems in the way our cells and our body funcitons.</p>
<p><strong>Telomere attrition</strong> - Our chromosomes have protective caps on their ends called telomeres. Every time a cell divides a small part of the telomere is removed. This effectively sets a limit on how many times a cell can divide and causes low cell counts in some organs as we age. It is also linked with a lot of aging deseases. Should also be this mechanism may exist for a reason to stop cells from dividing too much and developing cancerous mutations.</p>
<p><strong>Loss of proteostatis</strong> - The genes inside the cell describe how to create proteins. Sometimes this fails and creates “misfolded” proteins. When we age the amount of proteins that were created incorrectly grows which is the root cause of deseases such as Alzheimer’s</p>
<p><strong>Mitochondrial dysfunction</strong> - Mitochondria is a part of a cell that is in charge of converting food into energy for our cells. Basically its like the local power plant for each cell. As we age the mitochondrias start malfanctioning, fail creating energy, and release chemicals that harm the cells and causes inflamations.</p>
<p><strong>Deregulated nutrient sensing</strong> - There are four protein groups that are regulated partly by the amount of nutrients in our body. The proteins are Sirtuins, AMPK, mTOR, and IGF-1. Turning down the pathways that create mTOR and IGF-1, and activating the the pathways that create Sirtuins and AMPK benefits longevity. As we age these proteins become less regulated partly because the cells get worse at absorbing the nutrients in our body.</p>
<p><strong>Cellular Senescence</strong> - When cells stop replicating for various reasons (e.g. their telomeres got too short) they become senescent aka “zombie cells”. In young bodies the immune system is in charge of clearing these cells, but as we get older our body occumulents more and more senescent cells. Senescent cells lead to inflamations to the surrounding cells and tissue.</p>
<p><strong>Stem cell exhaustion</strong> - Stem cells are basically cells that can turn into any other cell type. They are essential in replacing other types of cells and help repair functions. As we age the stem cell activity decreases and the quality of the stem cells decreases (e.g some of them can become senescent because of telomere shortening).</p>
<p><strong>Altered intercellular communication</strong> - As a consequence of other hallmarks, as we age the communication between different cells (e.g. brain cells) becomes worse which reduces the functions of all organs.</p>
<h2 id="terminology">Terminology</h2>
<p>Epigenome - the epigenome is the structure of the genome. It is what determines how the genome is read. While the genome remains largely static, the epigenome changes all the time because of environmental factors (e.g. xrays).</p>
<p>Sirtuins - a set of proteins believed to regulate cell fertility and cellular repair.</p>
<p>GnRH</p>
<p>NF-kB</p>
<p>AMPK</p>
<p>mTOR</p>
<p>IGF-1</p>
<p>methylation</p>
<p>chromatin</p>
<p>NAD+</p>
<p>NMN</p>
<p>Resveratrol</p>
<p>Ribosomes</p>
<p>Chaperones</p>
<p>ATP</p>
<p>Pathways</p>
