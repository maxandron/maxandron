His persistence in getting the codes to work and trying to solve it and then explaining to us.

However, he really did his best to help me understand the topic during the practical exercise</li><li>I asked a lot to Ron, he answered all ! awesome</li><li>Every exercise is a challenge, but with Ron&#x27;s teaching style to say &quot;if you are stuck, call me&quot;. Therefore by asking him, i overcomed it alot. Plus he bothers to come to me and ask me how is it going. Awesome.</li><li>Pointers, After the tutor taught me how to read pointer warniings/errors, it was very easy</li><li>Overcame it with the help from Ron and discussing with other peers.</li></ul><h3 id="fc1c54d4-13bf-4f8f-b60b-4f1ff0be99bb" class="block-color-red">To Improve</h3><ul id="e47a946f-8fcd-4036-85e3-d9492dc5967d" class="block-color-red bulleted-list"><li>more time for the more advance topics</li><li>clearer agenda for the day.Some of the challenges were quite ambiguous and required further elaboration from the trainer.</li><li>maybe can consider splitting complex modules like this into smaller parts, so that we can take a break...and not have to continuously mind-fug ourselves?</li><li>Hmm, i think 1 week for c advanced is too short? That most topic can&#x27;t really cover too in depth. So pretty neutral to this question.</li><li>there should be more focus on how to safely program in c</li></ul></div>
