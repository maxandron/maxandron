    <h1>What I'm Doing Now</h1>

    <h2>Nomad Life</h2>

    <p>
      After working in a 9-to-6 job in Singapore for three years, I have
      transitioned to a nomadic lifestyle. <br />
      I will continue working part-time with DART, but remotely, from anywhere I
      want and at any time I choose. <br />
      For the first few months of this new chapter, Gal and I will be traveling
      through New Zealand in a camper van. <br />
      And of course, we brought Phoebe along with us! <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      Our next stop is Thailand, specifically Phuket, where we will be close to
      family.
    </p>

    <h2>Getting Married</h2>

    <p>
      I proposed to Gal a year ago, and she said yes. A few months later, she
      proposed to me, and I said yes as well. <br />
      We are planning to get married in early 2024. Small and intimate. We're doing it our way.
    </p>
