  <h2 id="ideation">Ideation</h2>
  <p>Before I was discharged from the army I had some time off due to a medical leave. Sitting still is not something I&#x27;m known for, so I looked for things to occupy my time. I took a bartenders course, helped check exercises for an ongoing Army course, and helped my brother prepare for his Radiology exam by creating a simple app that enabled case sharing and discussion.</p>
  <p>After I was discharged from the army, the obvious thing for me was to go work as a security engineer at a startup. Immediately upon release, I had quite a few offers from different places.</p>
  <p>The day I got the contract, I went to consult with Max about it. Little did I know, he had a similar plan for me. When we met, he gave me the news - the simple app I built had spread across the hospital and doctors, both junior and senior, were using it for different use cases.</p>
  <p>Both of us had the assumption that we will start a startup together one day without really knowing what it means. On the same night we went to consult each other, we made the decision to turn this into a company. We spent hours talking about how to spin this off, what to do, how we can make money, and what is the maximum we are willing to invest in this.</p>
  <h2 id="zero-to-student">From zero to ... student</h2>
  <p>The following morning I rejected the offer ***** made, and went to interview in IBM for a student&#x27;s position. I was quickly accepted and told to arrive there with a student ID. Since I wasn&#x27;t actually a student, I drove to the HQ of the open university, glossed over the syllabus, and chose Chineese History as my course. Payed for it, got the ID, and signed with IBM.</p>
  <p>Since I understood that I don&#x27;t know shit about entrepreneurship (not to mention writing the damn word without mistakes) I started learning - I bought some books on the subject, signed up to every possible meetup.</p>
  <p>I would wake up in the morning, read for an hour or two. Go work at IBM for 6~ hours. Drive to a meetup in the evening. Get home and code until the middle of the night. Read for a few more hours and repeat. Most of my waking hours, at least for a few months were spent digesting information.</p>
  <h2 id="team">Building the team</h2>
  <p>One of the first advice any business book gave me was to build a team. I decided we need to hire two people - one to counter myself (an iOS engineer and designer), and one more medical advisor from another hospital to counter Max). I found Itamar through a mutual friend. I just asked friends around me whether they knew a good designer.</p>
  <p>One of the first things we understood is that we need good legal advice when doing business in the medical field. Through connections, I found a recommendation on a lawyer and hired them as well.</p>
  <p>I couldn&#x27;t really pay anyone, I could only promise options that will be relevant only if the company succeeds. To my surprise back then, people believed in me.</p>
  <h2 id="business-model">Searching for a business model</h2>
  <p>Very close to the beginning, Yosef arranged a meeting with an Angel investor. I pitched the idea to her and the meeting ended when she asked me to send her a 5-year financial plan.</p>
  <p>After staying the next night up trying to come up with a 5-year plan, I understood I need an accountant as well.</p>
  <p>I ended up sending the a half-assed plan about a week later, and perhaps justifiably never received a reply back. I was so embarrassed by my lack of experience and the delay that I didn&#x27;t even follow up with her.</p>
  <p>I think she gave me this task (which seems stupid to me now) to show me what I eventually learned: we need a strong business plan that can scale. We came up with a plan to do sponsored medical content as a revenue steam, but even though it could potentially make millions a year, this was it.</p>
  <p>I understood that investors want to see a much bigger return on investment. Still, at this point, I was convinced that if we will benefit users, the money will come.</p>
  <p>We considered the following business models:</p>
  <ul id="00b9cfa4-6da2-4457-9653-8379b8902a16" class="bulleted-list">
      <li>selling targeted advertising space to medical device companies</li>
  </ul>
  <ul id="d6869a4a-29f6-4272-8ca4-84e206fe00d0" class="bulleted-list">
      <li>partnering with publishers to sell journal issues through the app.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul id="9635af1d-cb56-4f25-bddc-40bd1056ad36" class="bulleted-list">
      <li>Sell the service to hospitals directly</li>
  </ul>
  <ul id="59865d25-8e1f-424a-bf58-27f569b99e85" class="bulleted-list">
      <li>Use the app to help conduct research of similar cases</li>
  </ul>
  <ul id="52229116-1cbb-4c84-a63f-f2e9da9fcbbf" class="bulleted-list">
      <li>Sell statistical information to insurance companies</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We figured none of them mattered as long as we don&#x27;t have enough users.</p>
  <h2 id="ios">The iOS roadblock</h2>
  <p>While I was working on the Android app and the server, Itamar was working on the iOS app and the overall design.</p>
  <p>Coding for Android was much more fun - first I had the benefit of a large community with many tutorials, helpful libraries, and even kotlin which just reached version 1.0 and was incredibly fun to learn. On top of that, Maxim and Vova were the main QA testers and both owned Android phones.</p>
  <p>On iOS the story was completely different, the development was progressing slowly, the app would break constantly, and worst of all - we had to get an approval from Apple before publishing (since this is a medical app).</p>
  <p>As a result, the iOS app always lagged behind.</p>
  <h2 id="rsna">RSNA</h2>
  <p>Very early on Max proposed the idea of presenting at RSNA, the largest radiological conference in the world. Since we had to sign up early, a lot of my early actions were driven by this. Establishing a company was a prerequisite, choosing a logo, a design, a name were all necessary before applying.</p>
  <p>A testing ground was also required. First, we used Belinson, because Max worked there and the users were most engaged. Then we decided to use the Israeli radiological association as both a distribution partner and a testing ground. With some connections, we got familiar with the head of the association (Prof. Sosna), got to present the app in the annual convention, have a booth there, and connections to the sponsors.</p>

  <p>We worked hard to build our Israeli connections in the field. Some of the notable ones were the CEO of Mor (****) and Clalit&#x27;s CISO (Cohavi).</p>
  <p>Before flying to Chicago we designed and prepared our booth, acquired the giveaways, and set up meetings both with publishers such as Elsevier and medical device companies such as GE and Philips.</p>
  <p>In September we flew to Chicago a week early to get set up. Unfortunately Apple did not approve our app (on the 4th or 5th try) and we had to resort to writing down emails for Apple users.</p>
  <p>This was just a very fun week with the team. We set up our booth, started meeting with local influencers, and just enjoyed traveling in Chicago for a while.</p>

  <p>The week of the convention itself was the hardest week of my life until that moment in terms of schedule. We would wake up at 6 am, hurry to the convention to setup our booth in time for 8 am, then ran between pitching passer bys and the meetings we have scheduled in advance, grabbing a disgusting American coffee every once in a while. And talking none stop.</p>

  </figure>
  <p>When the convention closed at 6pm, we would pack our booth quickly, and hurry to the next meeting/dinner gathering we planned for the evening where we would keep pitching. Finishing around 12am, exhausted and unable to talk we would walk to a local bar for drinks, go to sleep around 2-3 am, and repeat. Although this was hard it was incredibly fun and rewarding.</p>
  <p>By the end of the week we had 200 more users in the app and 500 more Apple users&#x27; emails. But the engagement in the app was very low.</p>
  <h2 id="burnout">Burnout</h2>
  <p>About a month after the RSNA I tried going back to developing, but I was just drained. I didn&#x27;t want to do anything. I felt exausted and saw that I&#x27;m unable to work.</p>
  <p>First I thought its because I need stop working from home. Working in coffee shops helped a bit but did not solve the problem.</p>
  <p>To solve this I decided to take a semi-vacation. I bought last minute tickets to Berlin. Traveled around Berlin for half a day and worked the other half. This actually solved this period for me though I&#x27;m not sure I ever got back to the same productivity levels after that.</p>
  <p>Back then, I didn&#x27;t really know what this is. I didn&#x27;t hear about burnout and mainly blamed myself.</p>
  <h2 id="merger">Merger - almost</h2>
  <p>During the RSNA, *** connected us with *** and *** - the CEO of *** Medical at the time. We thought what they are doing is awesome, and they wanted us to meet further in Israel.</p>
  <p>We wanted that meeting to ask for their advice in fundraising. When we got there it turned out Eyal had a different plan. He proposed our teams should merge together so we could keep developing OLRAD with their resources instead of struggling with money.</p>
  <p>This led to a few months of negotiations, preparing offers and counter offers. When we finally agreed on the terms, they asked us to wait for the final approval of the board.</p>
  <p>The approval never came, they never contacted us back, and we went our separate ways.</p>
  <p>Around March we started understanding that we are done, the money was running out, and we had no viable options in our future.</p>
  <p>Around April was when we decided to stop. Soon after I took a 2 months vacation to the east.</p>
